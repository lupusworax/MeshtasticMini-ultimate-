# MiniX-FakeTec
An improved and updated variant of the original Meshtastic Mini

A user on Discord pointed me to a PCB design on a chinese website (https://oshwhub.com/shenye894/meshtastic-mini), intrigqued by the form factor and the almost identical used parts from a FakeTec board I ordered a bunch of them. 
After I received the parts I started building it right away and it worked flawless for the most part. Some issues with wrong hole diameters, wrong and confusing labeling, a missing short pad for boost charging were quickly fixed. 
Driving the board to its max potential there is now a 3rd mosfet for an additional rumble motor, as well 3 exposed more gpios for a navigation switch and also a notification LED, the board now pretty much offering evereyhting meshtastic has to offer. 
The already implemented buzzer and GPS mosfet worked perfectly fine.

The corrected and updated version is on the way to me and once I can confirm it working accordingly I will relase the files for it here.
